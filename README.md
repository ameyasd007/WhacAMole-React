# Whack-A-Mole Game

Built a popular arcade game where players attempt to hit moles as they pop up from holes in a board.

Technologies used: React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The game has a grid of 9 holes.
When the game starts, a mole will pop up randomly from one of the holes.
The player must click on the mole to whack it. When the player whacks the mole, they will get a point.
If the player does not whack the mole within 1.5 seconds, the mole will disappear.
The next mole randomly appears from one of the holes and the process repeats.
The player has 15 seconds to hit as many moles as possible.
The game ends when the timer runs out, the score is displayed and the player has the option to play again.
